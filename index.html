            <h2 class="first">EXPLORE NATURE !</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    All children are eager to connect with nature; given a chance, they develop a strong love for the earth and everything upon it.
                    Their senses are wide open to the great and the small as children watch moon and stars, they are awed to catch a glimpse of our 
                    planets place in the universe, while tiny creatures and objects grip their imaginations too. Perhaps the miniature size of ladybird,
                    tadpole or acorn rouses feelings of sympathy in young children. Often a child will stop to watch an ant or examine a pebble that an 
                    adult would not even notice.
                    <br>
                    Gentleness toward plants and animals can extend to understanding for fellow humans as a child develops.

                    <h2 class="desc" id="bc">MOUNTAIN</h2>
               </div>
               <P class="text">MOUNTAIN VACATION | Go feel the sun on your back and on your face. Go and see nature in its most raw beauty.
                 The mountains are the perfect place to retreat on your next vacation, to commune with nature. There are various activities to do while going to the mountains for example; hiking, climbing, fishing, canoeing, skiing, and camping.
                 Going up to the mountains also has health benefits- here are a few reasons why you should consider vacationing in the mountains!
                <br>
                <br>
                Even though the mountain views are the perfect backdrop for an Instagram photo, and will provide a cool filter for your location on Snapchat,
                disconnecting from your phone is an even greater reward. No picture can truly showcase the beauty of what you’re seeing with your eyes, 
                it’s like trying to take a picture of the beautiful moon on your phone, which always ends up looking lacklustre in picture format.

               </div>
               <P class="text">The sky joined the sea to make a whole blue in the horizon. The night cold breezes started to blow, 
                bringing magnificent sand and sea scents. The hunters were getting back from their daily journey.
                 Their lights were lit, leaving a gleaming stream of water behind. What an adventurous journey they had!  
               <br>
               <br>
               The sea was not like anything else ever created. It had a beautifully charming effect on people generally and 
               a relaxing and relieving one on others.
                Therefore,there are an immense amount of sea lovers.
               In the daytime, on a hot summer's day, its warm blue moving water, which got its colour from the blue of the sky, 
                was a heavenly enticing scene

            <span class="desc">WATERFALL</span>
            </div>
            <p class="text">A waterfall is any point in a river or stream where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of steep drops. 
                Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular iceberg or ice shelf.
                Waterfalls can be formed in several ways, but the most common method of formation is that a river courses over a top layer of
                resistant bedrock before falling onto softer rock, which erodes faster, leading to an increasingly high fall. 
                Waterfalls have been studied for their impact on species living in and around them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Waterfalls can pose major barriers to travel. Canals are sometimes built as a method to go around them, other times things
            must be physically carried around or a railway built.In 1885, the geographer George Chisholm wrote that, "The most signal
            example of the effect of waterfalls and rapids in retarding the development 
            of civilisation is undoubtedly presented by the continent of Africa, the 'darkness' of which is almost entirely due to this cause.

           <span class="desc">BEACH VIEW</span>
           </div>
           <p class="text">A beach view is a captivating blend of nature's most serene and awe-inspiring elements. Picture this: 
            the sun rising or setting, casting a golden or rosy hue across the horizon, where the sky meets the endless expanse of the ocean.
             The gentle waves roll in rhythmically, their white foam kissing the sandy shore.
            The beach itself is a canvas of soft, powdery sand, sometimes dotted with shells and smooth pebbles.
             Palm trees sway gracefully in the breeze, their leaves rustling like nature's own wind chimes. 
             The air is filled with the refreshing scent of saltwater and the distant cries of seagulls, adding to the symphony of sounds that include the
             soothing crash of waves and the occasional laughter of beachgoers.
           <br>
           <br>
           As you take in this scene, you feel a sense of peace and tranquility wash over you, 
            the worries of daily life melting away with each breath of the fresh, ocean breeze. 
            Whether you're basking in the sun, building sandcastles, or simply gazing out at the horizon, 
            a beach view is a timeless reminder of nature's beauty and the simple joys of life.

                    The rhythmic sound of waves crashing gently against the shore creates a soothing symphony that calms the mind.
                    The water itself can vary in color, from deep, mysterious blues to vibrant, crystal-clear turquoise, each hue reflecting the sky above. As the sun rises or sets,
                    the ocean transforms into a canvas of breathtaking colors, with shades of orange, pink, and purple dancing on the surface, creating a magical and serene atmosphere.

                The salty breeze carries the refreshing scent of the sea, mingling with the occasional calls of seagulls flying overhead.

                The gentle sway of the waves can be mesmerizing, drawing you into a state of relaxation and awe.
                 An ocean view offers a sense of vastness and freedom, a reminder of the beauty and power of nature.
                It's a place where you can find solace, reflect on life's wonders, and feel a deep connection to the world around you.
